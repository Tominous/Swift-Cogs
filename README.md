----

**Until Red v3 is considered stable, these cogs should be considered beta software, with no guarantee of stability.**
Breaking changes can and will be made, with or without warning, with backward compatibility not always implemented.

These cogs also expect that you're running on the v3 develop branch, instead of a tagged release,
as there may be uses of new features not present in any currently tagged release.

```
[p]repo add swift-cogs https://github.com/notodinair/Swift-Cogs.git
[p]cog install swift-cogs <cog>
[p]load <cog>
```
