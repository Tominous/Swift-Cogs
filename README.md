# odinair's Red v3 Cogs

**These cogs require Python 3.6!**

```
[p]repo add odinair https://github.com/notodinair/Red-Cogs.git v3
[p]cog install odinair <cog>
[p]load <cog>
```

## Cogs

### Bot Monitor

Monitors specified bots and sends a message in the specified channel when they go offline or when they come back up.

```
[p]cog install odinair botmonitor
[p]load botmonitor
```

### Cog Whitelist

Restricts use of specific cogs in guilds that aren't added to a whitelist by the bot owner

```
[p]cog install odinair cogwhitelist
[p]load cogwhitelist
```

### Logs

Log anything and everything that happens in your server

```
[p]cog install odinair logs
[p]load logs
```

### Misc Tools

Mainly a cog to help with development of other cogs, or advanced server administration.

```
[p]cog install odinair misctools
[p]load misctools
```

### Quotes

Save and retrieve quotes. Supports author attribution!

```
[p]cog install odinair quotes
[p]load quotes
```

### Require Role

Require a role (or a lack of) out of a list of roles to use the bot in a server

```
[p]cog install odinair requirerole
[p]load requirerole
```

### Random Activity

Randomly change the bot's activity status on a set interval to one in a set list.

```
[p]cog install odinair rndactivity
[p]load rndactivity
```

### Role Mention

Mention configurable roles on demand.
This can be helpful if you have roles which you don't want everyone to be able to mention, but still need to mention from time to time.

```
[p]cog install odinair rolemention
[p]load rolemention
```

### Starboard

It's almost like channel pins, except with stars

```
[p]cog install odinair starboard
[p]load starboard
```

### Timed Mute

**This cog requires [Timed Role](#timed-role)**

Temporarily mute a user in voice and text channels across an entire server

```
[p]cog install odinair timedmute
[p]load timedmute
```

### Timed Role

Add roles to users for a set amount of time, and automatically remove them after that time is up

```
[p]cog install odinair timedrole
[p]load timedrole
```

### UInfo

Yet another slightly different variation of the userinfo command.

```
[p]cog install odinair uinfo
[p]load uinfo
```
