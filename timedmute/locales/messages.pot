"        Muted users will not be able to send messages, add new reactions to messages\n"

"\n"
"        Examples for duration: `1h30m`, `3d`, `1mo`.\n"
"        Longer form values (such as '2 hours') are also accepted, but must be wrapped\n"
"        in double quotes if they contain spaces.\n"
"\n"
"        Abbreviations: `s` for seconds, `m` for minutes, `h` for hours, `d` for days,\n"
"        `w` for weeks, `mo` for months, `y` for years.\n"
"\n"
"        `m` assumes minutes instead of months.\n"
"\n"
"        One month is counted as 30 days, and one year is counted as 365 days.\n"
"        Minimum duration for a mute is 2 minutes.\n"
